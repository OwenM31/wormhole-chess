## Sessions

### Session: 2026-10-14 18:27

#### Objective
Initialize project harness via `/new-project` and map existing codebase via `/map`. Gather deep context on platform expansion (Home screen, Dashboard, Auth, 2D Deck Builder Chess, Cloudflare stack).

#### Accomplished
- ✅ Analyzed existing brownfield codebase: 12 source files, ~5,000 LOC, Create React App, React 19, Three.js, Wormhole 3D engine.
- ✅ Generated `.agent/state/ARCHITECTURE.md` cataloging 5 core components, data flow, and 7 technical debt items.
- ✅ Generated `.agent/state/STACK.md` with runtime, dependency, and file size inventories.
- ✅ Conducted Phase 3 Deep Questioning: defined Deck Builder Chess turn loop (play card + chess move), matchmaking scope, AI testing bot, guest session requirements, and Vite migration.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/SPEC.md` with finalized status, vision, goals, non-goals, and success criteria.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/REQUIREMENTS.md` with 11 functional requirements, 4 NFRs, and traceability matrix.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/ROADMAP.md` breaking down the milestone into 5 structured execution phases.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/DECISIONS.md` recording ADRs 001 through 004.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/TODO.md` and initialized `.agent/state/phases/`.

#### Verification
- [x] Codebase successfully built with existing `npm run build`.
- [x] All `.agent/state/` governance files adhere to harness specifications.

#### Handoff Notes
- Next step is to execute Phase 1: Modern Foundation, Vite Migration & Client Routing.
- Can start with `/plan 1` or `/discuss-phase 1`.
