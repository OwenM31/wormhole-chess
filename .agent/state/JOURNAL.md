## Sessions

### Session: 2026-10-14 19:18

#### Objective
Execute and verify Phase 2 (`/execute 2`): Cloudflare Backend, D1 Database & Authentication UI.

#### Accomplished
- ✅ Wave 1 (Plan 2.1): Installed Wrangler, configured D1 binding in `wrangler.toml`, designed SQLite schema in `d1/schema.sql`, implemented Web Crypto PBKDF2 hashing & constant-time check in `_crypto.ts`, cookie helpers in `_cookie.ts`, and full Pages Functions auth suite (`register`, `login`, `guest`, `logout`, `me`).
- ✅ Wave 2 (Plan 2.2): Built typed API client `api.ts`, React `AuthContext.tsx`, upgraded `Navigation.tsx` with dynamic user/guest states, implemented `AuthPage.tsx` with Login/Register/Guest tabs, built `DashboardPage.tsx` with combat stats and variant launchers, and configured Vite dev server proxy.
- ✅ Verified all Phase 2 must-haves in `VERIFICATION.md` with PASS verdict.
- ✅ Updated `ROADMAP.md` and `STATE.md` marking Phase 2 complete.

#### Verification
- [x] Production build passes cleanly in ~790ms (`npm run build`).
- [x] Edge functions typecheck clean (`npx tsc -p functions/tsconfig.json`).
- [x] All 6 Phase 2 must-haves verified in `VERIFICATION.md` (verdict: PASS).
- [ ] Phase 3 planning pending (`/plan 3`).

#### Paused Because
User requested session pause (`/pause`) at clean handoff point after successful Phase 2 execution and verification.

#### Handoff Notes
- Proceed to Phase 3: Real-Time Room Coordination & Durable Objects.
- Run `/plan 3` or `/discuss-phase 3` to architect the multiplayer room synchronization engine.

### Session: 2026-10-14 19:04

#### Objective
Discuss, research, and plan Phase 2 (`/discuss-phase 2`, `/research-phase 2`, `/plan 2`): Cloudflare Backend, D1 Database & Authentication UI.

#### Accomplished
- ✅ Aligned on backend topology and auth design: Cloudflare Pages Functions (`functions/api/*`) and HttpOnly session cookies backed by a D1 `sessions` table ([DECISION-005]).
- ✅ Researched edge-native Web Crypto API PBKDF2 hashing, confirming the 100,000 iteration ceiling in Cloudflare Workers and constant-time string comparison.
- ✅ Designed complete D1 relational schema covering `users`, `sessions`, `player_stats`, `matches`, and `custom_decks` with performance indexes.
- ✅ Created `01-PLAN.md` (Wave 1: Wrangler setup, D1 schema, crypto/cookie helpers, Pages Functions auth endpoints with guest upgrade).
- ✅ Created `02-PLAN.md` (Wave 2: AuthContext, dynamic Navigation bar, AuthPage, and DashboardPage UI).
- ✅ Validated plans across all 6 plan-checker dimensions with zero blockers.

#### Verification
- [x] All 6 plan-checker dimensions verified with zero blockers.
- [x] Production build passes cleanly in 800ms (`npm run build`).
- [ ] Phase 2 execution pending (`/execute 2`).

#### Paused Because
User requested session pause (`/pause`) at clean handoff point before Phase 2 execution.

#### Handoff Notes
- Run `/resume` or `/execute 2` to execute Phase 2 plans.
- Wave 1 (Plan 2.1) sets up backend primitives, and Wave 2 (Plan 2.2) connects the frontend views.

### Session: 2026-10-14 18:50

#### Objective
Execute and verify Phase 1 (`/execute 1`): modern Vite migration and client-side routing.

#### Accomplished
- ✅ Migrated project from Create React App (`react-scripts`) to Vite (`@vitejs/plugin-react`), upgrading TypeScript to 5.9 and types to modern standards.
- ✅ Maintained `build/` output directory for Cloudflare Pages backwards compatibility.
- ✅ Slashed production bundle build time from ~120s down to 800ms.
- ✅ Installed `react-router-dom` and configured multi-route hierarchy in `src/App.tsx`.
- ✅ Built top `Navigation.tsx` component with dark theme aesthetics and route navigation.
- ✅ Created `HomePage.tsx` with hero messaging, game variant cards (3D Wormhole & Deck Builder), and platform features.
- ✅ Encapsulated 3D Wormhole Chess engine inside `WormholePage.tsx` with floating return overlay and zero canvas distortion.
- ✅ Created shell placeholder views for `DeckBuilderPage.tsx`, `DashboardPage.tsx`, and `AuthPage.tsx`.
- ✅ Documented plan summaries (`01-SUMMARY.md`, `02-SUMMARY.md`) and verified all must-haves in `VERIFICATION.md` with PASS verdict.
- ✅ Updated `ROADMAP.md` marking Phase 1 complete.

#### Verification
- [x] Production build passes cleanly in 800ms (`npm run build`).
- [x] All 5 Phase 1 must-haves verified in `VERIFICATION.md` (verdict: PASS).
- [ ] Phase 2 planning pending (`/plan 2`).

#### Paused Because
User requested `/pause` after successful completion and verification of Phase 1. Clean handoff point before Phase 2.

#### Handoff Notes
- Run `/resume` to restore session state.
- Proceed with `/plan 2` to create execution plans for Phase 2: Cloudflare Backend, D1 Database & Authentication UI.

### Session: 2026-10-14 18:37

#### Objective
Pause session after completing project initialization (`/new-project`), codebase mapping (`/map`), and Phase 1 planning (`/plan 1`).

#### Accomplished
- ✅ Cataloged codebase architecture (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) and stack inventory (`STACK.md`).
- ✅ Aligned on project spec: Cloudflare Pages + Workers + D1 + Durable Objects, 2D Deck Builder Chess with simultaneous "play card + chess move" turn loop, simple AI testing bot, user & guest auth.
- ✅ Created finalized `SPEC.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, and 5-phase `ROADMAP.md`.
- ✅ Decomposed Phase 1 into 2 executable plans (`01-PLAN.md` and `02-PLAN.md`) with supporting `RESEARCH.md`.
- ✅ Validated plans against all 6 plan-checker dimensions with zero blockers.

#### Verification
- [x] Baseline production build verified (`react-scripts build` succeeded).
- [x] All 2 plans verified and structured into sequential waves.
- [ ] Phase 1 execution pending (`/execute 1`).

#### Paused Because
Session pause requested by user (`/pause`). All initial governance and planning artifacts are committed and ready for clean execution upon resumption.

#### Handoff Notes
- To resume work, use `/resume` or jump straight into execution with `/execute 1`.
- Phase 1 will migrate build tooling to Vite (Plan 1.1) and set up React Router with Home and Wormhole pages (Plan 1.2).

### Session: 2026-10-14 18:27

#### Objective
Initialize project harness via `/new-project` and map existing codebase via `/map`. Gather deep context on platform expansion (Home screen, Dashboard, Auth, 2D Deck Builder Chess, Cloudflare stack).

#### Accomplished
- ✅ Analyzed existing brownfield codebase: 12 source files, ~5,000 LOC, Create React App, React 19, Three.js, Wormhole 3D engine.
- ✅ Generated `.agent/state/ARCHITECTURE.md` cataloging 5 core components, data flow, and 7 technical debt items.
- ✅ Generated `.agent/state/STACK.md` with runtime, dependency, and file size inventories.
- ✅ Conducted Phase 3 Deep Questioning: defined Deck Builder Chess turn loop (play card + chess move), matchmaking scope, AI testing bot, guest session requirements, and Vite migration.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/SPEC.md` with finalized status, vision, goals, non-goals, and success criteria.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/REQUIREMENTS.md` with 11 functional requirements, 4 NFRs, and traceability matrix.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/ROADMAP.md` breaking down the milestone into 5 structured execution phases.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/DECISIONS.md` recording ADRs 001 through 004.
- ✅ Created `.agent/state/TODO.md` and initialized `.agent/state/phases/`.
